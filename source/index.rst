Bio
---------

I am a Ph.D. candidate at the Indiana University, Bloomington. My research covers a wide range of early Chinese literature and thought, Chi Feng 馮馳 is a PhD candidate in Chinese. Her research covers a wide range of early Chinese literature and thought, and she is particularly interested in materials related to music and cultural history. She began writing her dissertation in Spring 2026, and it will explore how people in early China imagined, described, and theorized musical instruments. She works with both musical artifacts and textual sources such as myths of origins, ritual guidelines, theories of musical philosophy, descriptions of performance contexts, and treatises on production technologies.

Beyond research, she is also a guqin practitioner and a keyboard player. She plays the piano, and she is currently learning the organ and the carillon. In addition, she received a PhD minor in Music Theory at the Jacobs School of Music. As a teacher, she runs a course with the title "Music and Society in Early China" under both EALC and Music.

Before coming to IU, Chi got her bachelor's degree in philosophy from Tongji University (2019), and master's degrees in Chinese (2022) and in Religious Studies (2022) from the University of Colorado, Boulder.

Working Dissertation
--------------------------

With the working title “Crafted Sound: Meanings of Musical Instruments in Early China,” Chi’s dissertation examines musical instruments as both objects of sound production and as carriers of cultural meaning. Existing scholarship tends to split along two lines: studies grounded in texts often treat instruments as abstract symbols, while archaeological and acoustical analyses portray them as autonomous material objects. However, burial contexts and textual records often tell inconsistent stories that challenge the assumed continuity between ideal, practice, and understanding. Rather than attempt to reconcile these inconsistencies by seeking “historical accuracy,” her dissertation will argue for a more holistic approach that views musical instruments as conceptual, social, and material constructs. 

Drawing inspiration from literary studies, thing theories, and sound studies, Chi’s dissertation will redefine musical instruments along a spectrum from instrumentality to symbolism. It will articulate the ontological ambiguity of sound-making objects and examine their participation in networks of knowledge, belief, and political order. She hopes her dissertation will contribute not only to early Chinese cultural history, but also to interdisciplinary conversations on materiality and sound.


個人簡介
---------------------------
馮馳，博士候選人。研究興趣涵蓋先秦兩漢的文學與思想史，特別關注與音樂及文化史相關的材料，探討早期中國的人們如何想像、描寫並思考樂器及其聲音。於 2026 年春季開始撰寫博士論文，研究對象包括樂器實物，以及神話敘事、禮制規範、樂論與工藝技術文獻等多種文本。

除研究之外，我亦愛好古琴與鋼琴。我於2024年完成音樂理論博士輔修項目。目前正在學習管風琴與鐘琴。在教學方面，目前在東亞系與音樂學院共同開設「早期中國的音樂與社會」本科課程。

此前，我分別於上海同濟大學取得哲學學士（2019），於科羅拉多大學波爾德分校取得中文碩士（2022）與宗教研究碩士（2022）。

博士論文構想
---------------------------
我的博士論文暫題為《造聲：早期中國樂器的知識形態》。本研究以樂器為切入點，探討其作為「發聲之器」與「文化意義之載體」的雙重角色。既有研究往往分成兩類：以文獻為主者傾向將樂器視為抽象象徵，而以考古與聲學分析為主者則將其看作脫離人群而獨立存在的物質技術。然而，墓葬配置與文獻記載時常呈現差異，顯示「理念—實踐—理解」之間並非如傳統所言能自然連為一體。

本論文不以追索單一「歷史真相」為目的，而是提出一種更為整體的視角，將樂器視為概念性、社會性與物質性並存的複合構成。借鑑文學研究、物的理論與聲音研究的相關成果，本研究主張樂器的意義在「器用」與「象徵」之間形成一個流動的光譜，並嘗試闡明聲響器物在知識、信仰與政治秩序中的位置與作用。期望此研究不僅能深化我們對早期中國文化史的理解，也能對更廣泛的物質性與聲音研究提供新的思考方向
